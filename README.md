TaskManagementBasic App

I created this app which also includes feature of sharedpreference like user can store their username and mode preference(Dark or light) so that next time they get same. and more thing is that user can add task in list view,
here that alertdialog concept is also there so that user can delete tasks, on clicking user can edit tasks too and in list view it shows task. this is not storing task but app is basically made to 3 in 1 feaure
shared preference + crud in listview + alertdialog
